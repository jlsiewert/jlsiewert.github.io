Until now, most AR apps were built using full gaming engines like Unreal, Unity3D or Apple’s SceneKit.\nRealityKit is a new Swift framework specifically for building AR applications.\nIt offers some nice features but I still need some time to figure everything out.\n\n### ~~Marzipan~~ Catalyst and SwiftUI\n\nWe all thought Marzipan would be the story of the year.\nI think we were wrong.\nNot only because Marzipan was rebranded to Project Catalyst (or UIKit for Mac in the documentation)\nbut because Apple introduced a completely new, declarative UI framework: SwiftUI.\nAgain I need some time to figure everything out but it looks like a fresh new take on UI development.\n\nBecause it only works on macOS 10.15 and iOS 13 we will probably need a couple of years until our favourite apps adapt it though.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \t\t\nBecause it only works on macOS 10.15 and iOS 13 we will probably need a couple of years until our favourite apps adapt it though.\n\n----\n\nI am looking forward to play with all the new SDKs and betas in the summer.\nIf you have any comments get in touch with me on [micro.blog](https://micro.blog/jl_siewert).\n",

extract the facial expressions from a face use the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arfaceanchor/2928251-blendshapes\"><code>.blendShapes</code></a> property.\nARKit automatically assigns certain facial expressions a weight from 0 to 1.\nExamples for <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arfaceanchor/blendshapelocation\"><code>BlendShapeLocations</code></a> are for example <a href=\"eyeBlinkLeft\"><code>.eyeBlinkLeft</code></a> or <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arfaceanchor/blendshapelocation/2928236-jawopen\"><code>.jawOpen</code></a>.\nThe meaning if the weight for each blend shape can be found in the documentation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"creating-a-character-model-in-blender\">Creating a character model in Blender</h2>\n<p>Now that we now about the basics of Face Tracking let&rsquo;s take a look into how to create an animatable character in <a href=\"https://www.blender.org\">Blender</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/4251/2019/d81cd358bd.png\" alt=\"Netral model in Blender\"></p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s assume you have a simple face model in blender with a neutral facial expression.\nBlender supports <em>shape keys</em>.\nThese are modification you can do on the base geometry.\nPress the plus button (you need to be in object mode).\nThis creates the neutral <em>Basis</em>.\nNow modify your character, for example by closing the left eye\n(only move vertices, all shapes need to be <strong>topologically identical</strong>, that is,\nhave the same number of vertices, edges and faces).\nThen press the plus button again and name the key e.g. <em>CloseLeftEye</em>.\nAs you can see, you can assign a weight between 0 and 1 for the shape\n(sounds familiar?).\nNow, create a shape key for every <code>ShapeBlendLocation</code> you want to support in ARKit.\nAs you can see you can then individually assign an arbitary weight to each shape.\nBlender than applies all shape modifications at the same time.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/4251/2019/b1451595ca.png\" alt=\"Shape Keys in Blender\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"get-the-character-into-scenekit\">Get the character into SceneKit</h2>\n<p>Export the model as an <code>.dae</code> file (check that <em>Include Shape Keys</em> is set in the options).\nFor SceneKit to read this file you need to fix a few properties in the file.\nThankfully, there is a <a href=\"https://github.com/JonAllee/ColladaMorphAdjuster\">great tool by <em>JonAlle</em> on GitHub</a> that does this for us.</p>\n<p>Then add the file to your <code>.scnassets</code> where you can convert it to an <code>.scn</code> file.\nIn the Xcode editor you can also confirm that the shape keys are working as expected.</p>\n<p><img

referenced by a number in which is was defined in Blender.\nTo make working with those easier we can create a simple enum that makes the reference explicit.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre

ARFaceAnchor else {\n                return\n            }\n            self.process(face.blendShapes)\n        }\n        \n    }\n{{< /highlight >}}\n\nTo extract the facial expressions from a face use the [`.blendShapes`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arfaceanchor/2928251-blendshapes) property.\nARKit automatically assigns certain facial expressions a weight from 0 to 1.\nExamples for [`BlendShapeLocations`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arfaceanchor/blendshapelocation) are for example [`.eyeBlinkLeft`](eyeBlinkLeft) or [`.jawOpen`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arfaceanchor/blendshapelocation/2928236-jawopen).\nThe meaning if the weight for each blend shape can be found in the documentation.\n\n## Creating a character model in Blender \n\nNow that we now about the basics of Face Tracking let's take a look into how to create an animatable character in [Blender](https://www.blender.org).\n\n![Netral model in Blender](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/4251/2019/d81cd358bd.png)\n\nLet's assume you have a simple face model in blender with a neutral facial expression.\nBlender supports *shape keys*.\nThese are modification you can do on the base geometry.\nPress the plus button (you need to be in object mode).\nThis creates the neutral *Basis*.\nNow modify your character, for example by closing the left eye\n(only move vertices, all shapes need to be **topologically identical**, that is,\nhave the same number of vertices, edges and faces).\nThen press the plus button again and name the key e.g. *CloseLeftEye*.\nAs you can see, you can assign a weight between 0 and 1 for the shape\n(sounds familiar?).\nNow, create a shape key for every `ShapeBlendLocation` you want to support in ARKit.\nAs you can see you can then individually assign an arbitary weight to each shape.\nBlender than applies all shape modifications at the same time.\n\n![Shape Keys in Blender](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/4251/2019/b1451595ca.png)\n\n## Get the character into SceneKit\n\nExport the model as an `.dae` file (check that *Include Shape Keys* is set in the options).\nFor SceneKit to read this file you need to fix a few properties in the file.\nThankfully, there is a [great tool by *JonAlle* on GitHub](https://github.com/JonAllee/ColladaMorphAdjuster) that does this for us.\n\nThen add the file to your `.scnassets` where you can convert it to an `.scn` file.\nIn the Xcode editor you can also confirm that the shape keys are working as expected.\n\n![Character in SceneKit](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/4251/2019/a12e280720.png)\n\n## Animating the character\n\n\nIn SceneKit all shape keys are referenced by a number in which is was defined in Blender.\nTo make working with those easier we can create a simple enum that makes the reference explicit.\n\n{{< highlight swift >}}\nenum Modifier: Int {\n        case closeLeftEye = 0\n        case closeRightEye\n        case openMouth\n        case smileLeft\n        case smileRight\n        case liftLeftBrow\n        case liftRightBrow\n        case tongueOut\n    }\n{{< /highlight >}}\n\nWe than use the [`SCNMorpherClass`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/scenekit/scnmorpher) to apply the differnt keys with their weights.\n\n{{< highlight swift >}}\nfunc changeModifiers(_ modifiers: [Modifier: CGFloat]) {\n        for (modifier, value) in modifiers {\n            characterNode.morpher?.setWeight(value, forTargetAt: modifier.rawValue)\n        }\n    }\n{{< /highlight >}}\n\nAll we have to do now is to change the weights when we get a new update for our face anchor.\n\n{{< highlight swift >}}\nfunc process(_ blendShapes: [ARFaceAnchor.BlendShapeLocation : NSNumber]) {\n        let modifiers = blendShapesToModifiers(blendShapes)\n        changeModifiers(modifiers)\n    }\n\nfunc blendShapesToModifiers(_ blendShapes: [ARFaceAnchor.BlendShapeLocation : NSNumber]) -> [CharacterController.Modifier: CGFloat] {\n        var modifiers: [CharacterController.Modifier: CGFloat] = [:]\n        \n        if let leftEye = blendShapes[.eyeBlinkRight] {\n            modifiers[.closeLeftEye] = CGFloat(truncating: leftEye)\n        }\n        if let rightEye = blendShapes[.eyeBlinkLeft] {\n            modifiers[.closeRightEye] = CGFloat(truncating: rightEye)\n        }\n        if let mouthOpen = blendShapes[.jawOpen] {\n            modifiers[.openMouth] = CGFloat(truncating: mouthOpen)\n        }\n        if let smileLeft = blendShapes[.mouthSmileRight] {\n            modifiers[.smileLeft] = CGFloat(truncating: smileLeft)\n        }\n        if let smileRight = blendShapes[.mouthSmileLeft] {\n            modifiers[.smileRight] = CGFloat(truncating: smileRight)\n        }\n        if let browLeft = blendShapes[.browDownRight] {\n            modifiers[.liftLeftBrow] = 1 - CGFloat(truncating: browLeft)\n        }\n        if let browRight = blendShapes[.browDownLeft] {\n            modifiers[.liftRightBrow] = 1 - CGFloat(truncating: browRight)\n        }\n        if let tongue = blendShapes[.tongueOut] {\n            modifiers[.tongueOut] = CGFloat(truncating: tongue)\n        }\n        \n        return modifiers\n    }\n{{< /highlight >}}\n\nThat's it.\nUsing the `SCNMorpher` together with Blender's *shape keys* and ARKit *blend shapes* is super easy to setup.\n\nIf you (like me) are completely untalented in creating 3D models you can simply\ndownload one from the internet. If you are a student you can use the [Autodesk Character Generator](https://charactergenerator.autodesk.com), where you can create character models in an RPG-like fashion, for free. They even support shape keys!\n",
